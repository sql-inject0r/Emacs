* My Minimal Emacs Config
  -Note that the config.org and readme are the same

* How to use my config -
** its very simple just type the commands in your 
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo rm -rf .emacs.d
     git clone https://github.com/sql-inject0r/Emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC
   - NOTE: removing your .emacs.d directory will wipe all its content so backup
     your own config otherwise it will be deleted !
