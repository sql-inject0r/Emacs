* My Minimal Emacs Config
  -Note that the config.org and readme are the same

* How to use my config -
** its very simple just type the commands in your 
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sudo rm -rf .emacs.d
     git clone https://github.com/sql-inject0r/Emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC
   - NOTE: removing your .emacs.d directory will wipe all its content so backup
     your own config otherwise it will be deleted !
* NOTE -
  - I'm sad to announce till my boards are not clear I will not work on my Emacs config
  - Just a couple of months and I will get through this
  - I will be deleting my virtual machine as well
  - Goodbye friend :(
